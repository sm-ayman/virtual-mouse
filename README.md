# Virtual Mouse with Hand Tracking

This project uses OpenCV, MediaPipe, and PyAutoGUI to create a virtual mouse that tracks your hand movements through your computer's webcam. You can control the mouse cursor and perform clicks using hand gestures.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`pip install opencv-python`)
- MediaPipe (`pip install mediapipe`)
- PyAutoGUI (`pip install pyautogui`)

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/virtual-mouse.git
   
Controls:
- Move the cursor: Use your index finger to control the cursor.
- Click: Make a gesture with your thumb and index finger to simulate a mouse click.

Notes:
- Ensure proper lighting conditions for accurate hand tracking.
- Adjust the sensitivity by modifying the threshold values in the script.

Acknowledgments:
This project was inspired by the concept of virtual mouse control using computer vision.
